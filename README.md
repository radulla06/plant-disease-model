# Plant Disease Model

This was my sophomore year research project. I created a CNN that attempted to classify plant diseases given an image of a plant leaf.
The data used for the model creation came from Samir Battarai's Kaggle dataset, "New Plant Diseases Dataset". https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset
The data used for the model testing came from spMohanty's GitHub repo, "PlantVillage-Dataset". https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset
